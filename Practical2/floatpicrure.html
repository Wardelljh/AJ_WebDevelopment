	<h1>Coffee is a Brewed Drink</h1>
    <img src="coffe.jpg">
	<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee. This process gives coffee its distinct aroma and flavor.</p>
	<p>However, some studies suggest that the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart diseases, especially in people with high cholesterol levels. It is recommended to consume coffee in moderation and with consideration to one's own health profile.</p>
